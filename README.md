# Wizard's Castle Information

## Disclaimer

I did not write this game. But I've probably played it more times than
any other game, so I'm definitely an enthusiast.

All the information presented here is in the interest of preserving this
piece of computing history.

My main contribution here is the (ongoing) production of a game spec
that describes in detail the rules for the game.
